Android-ANPR
============

Android number plate recognition

The app reads a (UK) number plate from a live camera stream, gives you the option to edit it (as the read is not perfect) and then sends the VRM to a fake service that returns vehicle details.

The app was designed as a proof of concept so has only been tested on a Galaxy S4.

The OpenCV and Tesseract OCR libraries are used for image processing and OCR respectively.
